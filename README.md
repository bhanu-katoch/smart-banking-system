## Installation & Setup

### Backend (Java)

1. Clone the backend repo.
2. Configure database (MySQL) and update `application.properties`.
3. Run the Spring Boot application (`mvn spring-boot:run`).

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the React project folder.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Notes

- Ensure Java backend is running before starting React frontend.
- `node_modules` is included in `.gitignore`.
- API calls are in `src/api/` folder, making it easy to switch endpoints or mock data.
