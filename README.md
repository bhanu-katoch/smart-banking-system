# 💳 Smart Banking System & Personal Finance Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview

Smart Banking System is an advanced Java-based backend application combined with a modern React frontend dashboard. It integrates multiple banking features including account management, transactions, loan and interest calculations, stock portfolio tracking, expense budgeting, and personal finance insights.

The React dashboard consumes REST APIs exposed by the Java backend to display real-time data.

> 💡 **Implementation Idea (Backend Java)**
>
> - Define classes for each user type: `Student`, `Professional`, `BusinessOwner`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Traveler`.
> - Implement service interfaces like `BudgetingService`, `LoanService`, `ForexService`.
> - Use polymorphism to provide tailored services for each user.
> - Store user data in a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or use HashMaps for a prototype.
